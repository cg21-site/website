CG21 EXIM is an indenting and trading company with offices in Singapore, India and China. We source raw material from reputed global manufacturers and sell across Indian and International markets.

The experienced leadership and team have helped achieve reputation & trust of suppliers and customers across the globe. Supplying raw materials to Tyre, Rubber Industries, Wire & Cable, Masterbatch and other industries has helped to diversify as a company and grow organically.

CG21 EXIM was a dream of our founder/ director, Mr.&nbsp;Gaurav&nbsp;Surana who left his corporate job in 2010. He always had a passion to get into export and import business which gave him zeal and focus to start from home and within 10 years grown over into annual sales of USD 20 million plus with offices in multiple countries. His transparent and ethical business attitude helped to win customer’s and supplier’s confidence with strong bonding relationship. Sourcing also increased from 1 country to 10 countries to get quality products at competitive prices. Meeting customer’s expectations Mr. Gaurav always believes in the mantra - right team with the right attitude will always give long term success and sustainability for any business.

We are thankful to all the customers and suppliers who believe in CG21 and have contributed towards the company’s growth.
